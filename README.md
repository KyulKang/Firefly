# Firefly
A simple neural network simulator.

It's a pretty much barebones ML simulator that trains a swarm of what are most definitely fireflies to survive for as long as possible.

The credit for most of the concepts used in this project that went over my head goes to Dr. Radu Mariescu Istodor.

Future updates for aesthetic enhancement likely, although I can't make any promises. Press space to save, and the minus button to
discard the neural network if it bothers you that the swarm flies backwards for some reason. Hope you enjoy!
